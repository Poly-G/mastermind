Welcome to MASTERMIND. May the odds be ever in your favor.

## STORY LINE

You and I have are in the process of robbing a bank. I am outside waiting in a white van giving you instructions and feedback on how to break into the vault.

The vault is a 4 number combination vault, therefore it will only take numbers as an input. You have 2 minutes and 10 attempts in order to crack the code.

2.  Follow these steps to play locally on your computer:

    1. Clone this repo onto your local machine.
    2. Navigate to the root folder of the repo and install the dependencies via `yarn install`.
    3. Once you have successfully installed the dependencies, `yarn start` will start the game up.

Once you have one of the steps above working then you can start playing!

3. You can only input numbers.
